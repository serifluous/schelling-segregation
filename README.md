Schelling's Segregation Model
=====================
Thomas Schelling's Segregation Model shows that very small preferences for one's neighbors to be of a certain type (e.g., race) can lead to widespread, or even total, segregation. Using pennies and nickels, Schelling placed coins on a grid and moved them around if they were "unsatisfied" by their neighbors.

I've simulated his model here, where the Schelling function takes:

* The total population of up to three "types" of people (red, green, and blue)
* Each type's minimum ratio of neighbors of same type to total neighbors for them to be satisfied with their current housing location
